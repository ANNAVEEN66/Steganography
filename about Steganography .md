# Steganography
Steganography is the art and science of hiding secret information inside ordinary files such as images, audio, or video, without leaving obvious traces. Unlike cryptography (which hides the content of a message), steganography hides the very existence of the message.
This project demonstrates how to:

Encode (hide) text messages inside image files.

Decode (extract) hidden messages from images.

Preserve the cover file’s appearance so the hidden data is not easily detectable.

Use techniques like Least Significant Bit (LSB) manipulation for simple image steganography.
Features

Hide secret text inside images.

Extract hidden text from stego images.

Works with common formats (e.g., PNG, BMP).

Lightweight and easy to use.
Example Workflow

Choose a cover image.

Encode your secret message into it.

Share the image – it looks the same to the naked eye.

The receiver can decode the hidden message using the tool.
Use Cases

Secure communication.

Digital watermarking.

Protecting sensitive information.

Fun/educational projects in cybersecurity.
